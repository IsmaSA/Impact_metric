\title{Calculate the Area of a Radar Chart}
\usage{
calculate_radar_area(values)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{A numeric vector of values, typically normalized between 0 and 1, representing
the data points for each axis of the radar chart.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the area enclosed by the radar chart. The area will be
between 0 and the maximum possible area, where all values are equal to 1.
}
\description{
This function calculates the area enclosed by a radar chart using the Shoelace Theorem.
It computes the area of the polygon formed by the normalized values on the radar chart's axes.
The area is returned as a numeric value, representing the extent of the data in relation to
the maximum possible values.
}
\details{
The Shoelace Theorem is used to calculate the area of a polygon given its vertices. The function
assumes that the values are normalized to \link{0, 1}, with 1 representing the maximum possible value
for each axis.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
values <- c(0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.5, 0.6)
area <- calculate_radar_area(values)
print(area)  # Output the area of the radar chart
